This program takes in an image and text from a subreddit. The program applies the image filter specified by the user text, to the user input image. The edited image is then reposted to the subreddit.

Supported Image Filters and Transformations:

* Sepia
* Grayscale
* Negative
* Output Scale Down

Future work: Add more image filters and transformations including a chromakey function that allows image transpositioning.
